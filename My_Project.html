    <h1>Fintech Effect </h1>

    <p>The explosive growth of the FinTech sector has reshaped the financial landscape, challenging traditional banks to adapt or risk obsolescence. While some banks view FinTech as a disruptive threat, others have embraced it, investing heavily in their own FinTech initiatives. This paradox raises a fascinating question: if FinTech undermines the traditional banking model, why are banks so eager to be part of the revolution? This data visualization project dives into this puzzle, exploring the interplay between FinTech and traditional banking. Does FinTech complement or compete with established banking systems? By examining the data, we aim to shed light on this critical question for financial inclusion, innovation, and regulatory policy. The first section explore some descriptive statistics and the second one tries to address the question.  </p>

    <h2> The Fintech Landscape </h2>
    <p> The first figure highlights the remarkable global growth of FinTech finance over the past decade. Although regulatory changes in China caused a notable decline in its market share, the overall trend has remained upward. In 2020, the United States and the United Kingdom emerged as the leading markets for alternative finance, reflecting a shift in global dynamics as these regions expanded their presence in the industry. Local market conditions and evolving regulations continue to shape the landscape of FinTech finance worldwide.</p>
    <figure id="P1"></figure> 
    <p> This figure shows the relationship between GDP per capita and the size of the Fintech sector. Logarithmic scale is used due to large variance in values across countries. There figure shows there is a positive correlation between the two variables, showing that usually the richer countries are the ones that have the most developed Fintech landscapes. However, some regional dispersion calles the atention.  . </p>

    <h2>Fintech vs. Banks </h2>
    <p>
        This section aims to explore the interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Building on the literature (Ben Naceur et al., 2023; Cornelli et al., 2020), I analyzed various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, savings banks, Islamic banks, cooperative banks, and microfinance institutions. To assess bank profitability, I computed the average profit per country using two key variables: return on equity (ROE) and profit margin.
    </p>
    <p> 
To measure the size of the FinTech industry, I used the total alternative finance transaction volume generated by each country, expressed in USD. Recognizing that larger countries might naturally exhibit higher levels of FinTech activity, I also considered transaction volume per capita. Given the significant variation across countries, FinTech activity was measured in logarithmic terms to account for its large dispersion.
</p>
<p>
The figures below indicate a modest negative correlation between the size of the FinTech industry and banks' profitability across countries. However, this does not necessarily imply that the growth of the FinTech sector reduces bank profitability. It is also possible that FinTech companies are more likely to emerge in financial environments where bank profitability is already low.

    <h2> Conclusions and Future Work </h2>
    <p>The results of this project should not be interpreted as evidence of causality due to the bidirectional relationship between FinTech development and bank performance. While FinTech growth may influence bank profitability through competition or collaboration, it is equally plausible that FinTech expands in regions where banks are less profitable, targeting unmet demand or inefficiencies. This mutual influence complicates establishing a causal relationship, as FinTech development (the independent variable) may be correlated with the model’s error term.
    </p>
    <p> This project is a first step for my dissertation, which plans to address this issue. An instrumental variable (IV) approach could be employed with that purpose. Potential instruments could be the share of individuals using the Internet and mobile cellular suscriptions, which are key drivers of FinTech growth (Haddad and Hornuf, 2019). For an instrument to be valid, it must meet two conditions: relevance (a strong connection to FinTech growth) and exogeneity (independence from the model’s error term). The final graphs in this project evaluate whether the relevance condition of these potential instruments are satisfied.</p>

    <h2> Data Sources and Challenges </h2>

    <p>
  The data for this project was obtained from three sources. 
  First, the <a href="https://ccaf.io/about_ccaf" target="_blank">Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF)</a> at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, which kindly shared data on FinTech transaction volumes for this project. 
  Second, <a href="https://www.bvdinfo.com/" target="_blank">Moody's Orbis database by Bureau van Dijk</a>, which provided bank-level profitability data that I aggregated by country. 
  Third, the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank Group Data Bank</a>, including information on total population used to compute FinTech transaction volumes per capita.
</p>
<p> The primary challenge with the data lies in its recency, as the latest available dataset is from 2020. Given the dynamic nature of the FinTech industry, much like other technological markets, significant developments could have occurred in the subsequent four years. Access to more recent data would greatly enhance the quality and relevance of the analysis. Additionally, because the data has not been updated in recent years, I considered that incorporating an automation component into this project was unnecessary. Furthermore, the CCAF does not currently offer an API for data access. Nonetheless, since the information is presented on the website in a table format, web scraping should be relatively straightforward. </p>
