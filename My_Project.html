    <p> This figure shows the relationship between GDP per capita and the size of the Fintech sector. Logarithmic scale is used due to large variance in values across countries. There figure shows there is a positive correlation between the two variables, showing that usually the richer countries are the ones that have the most developed Fintech landscapes. However, some regional dispersion calles the atention.  . </p>

        The figure below illustrates there is a negative correlation between the size of the fintech industry and banks' profitability across countries, but this does not necessarily imply that fintechs cause banks to become less profitable. On one hand, fintech companies could introduce increased competition in the financial industry, pressuring banks to lower fees to retain customers. On the other hand, other factors may be at play. For instance, the reverse effect is also possible. Lower bank profitability might create opportunities for fintech innovation and growth, as gaps in the financial system provide space for new entrants to thrive.
