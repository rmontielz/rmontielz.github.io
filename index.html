    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->

           The first graph shows UK childhood obesity rising above a stable global average. The second graph highlights how eating healthy is less affordable for lower-income families.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               I recreated and refined the chart from Food Foundation by combining two graphs into a single, streamlined visualization, reducing unnecessary "ink" for better clarity. I corrected a meaningless color variation in the original and removed the redundant repetition of the word "year" by incorporating it into the axis label. </p>

                I used Pandas and the Banco Central de Chile's recently introduced API to scrape  Gross Fixed Capital Formation data. Click to see the Python code I used. I chose it because the Chilean Central Bank is an institution from which I will frequently need data, and learning its API is highly useful.</p>
